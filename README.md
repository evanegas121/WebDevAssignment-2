For this assignment, you will recreate these methods using JavaScript functions. Make sure to carefully understand what each method is designed to do, and DO NOT use any of the respective native JS methods to implement your solutions. Strongly suggested: use Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs linked above to understand how each native method works. Pay attention to what arguments they take as well as the return value.
